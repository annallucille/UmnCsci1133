  1) Windchill
   Write a Python program that will prompt the user to enter a temperature t in degrees Fahrenheit and a wind velocity v 
   in miles/hour. Compute and output the Wind Chill Temperature according to the following formula (this is a math formula; 
   you will need to change the syntax a little to convert it to Python):
      wind_chill = 35.74 + 0.6215t - 35.75(v^0.16) + 0.4275t(v^0.16)
  2) Spare Change
   Write a Python program that will input a monetary (dollar) value and determine the minimum number of coins (quarters,
   dimes, nickels and pennies) whose total equals the entered value.
   Your program must input two integer values representing the dollars and cents, respectively, and then determine and 
   output the minimum number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies whose total equals the entered value.
